# Human Emotion Recognition Project

A real-time facial emotion recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. This project classifies emotions from webcam input using a custom-trained CNN model and displays the results live on screen.

---

## 💡 Motivation

With the rise of interactive systems and mental health monitoring tools, real-time emotion recognition plays a crucial role in building adaptive and empathetic technologies. This project explores how deep learning can be applied to interpret human emotions through facial cues.
